# Arduino_HomeKit_SmartSwitch
In this video, I will show you how easy it is to connect an Arduino NodeMCU (ESP8266) to Apple Homekit and use it to control your Smart Home from your iPhone, iPad, iWatch, and Mac. I will also provide you with a 3D model that you can 3D print to make your project more compact!  Once complete, why not try to turn your lights by simply saying, "Hey Siri! Turn the lights on!"
